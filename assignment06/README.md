## BrobInt
### Assignment Due: Tuesday 05.05.2020

BrobInt (short for Brobdingnagian Integer) objects model arbitrarily large integers.
The task of the assignment was to re-invent some of the material of java.math.BigInteger.
Since BrobInt is not a program we were also tasked with building a Collatz program that uses BrobInt.
This folder also contains a testing file for BrobInt and the javadoc for BrobInt as well.
